# Bookstore-Application
This project is a Java/JavaFX–based bookstore application. The goal was to design and build a small but realistic software system that applies object-oriented programming concepts and software design principles.

The application supports role-based access, allowing different functionality for owners and customers. Owners can manage the bookstore’s inventory and pricing, while customers can browse books and make purchases through a clean, reusable JavaFX user interface. The system was designed with modularity in mind, using well-structured classes and reusable UI components to keep the codebase organized and easy to maintain.

UML diagrams were created to model the system architecture and guide the implementation, ensuring a clear separation of responsibilities and consistent object-oriented design. Overall, this project demonstrates practical experience with Java, JavaFX, OOP principles, and translating design models into a working application.
